Important Notice – BETA Version

This modpack is currently in BETA, meaning it is still under active development and not yet considered complete. While the core gameplay loop is functional, many features are still being tested, and the overall balance and experience are subject to change.

You may encounter bugs, performance issues, or incomplete systems, especially as new mods are added or adjusted. We’re still experimenting with mod combinations, progression, balance, and world generation to deliver a unique and enjoyable experience.

New content is being added regularly, and updates may include new mods, custom features, balance tweaks, and more. Because of this, worlds created in this version may not always be compatible with future versions.

We truly appreciate your patience and support during this phase. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please share your feedback—it helps us shape the final version of the modpack.

Keep in mind: what you’re playing now is just the beginning. There’s much more planned.
